## Game
**Contact Tracers** is a survival game. It involves different kinds of healthy balls that bounce in random directions within the screen. A deadly virus is capable of infecting healthy balls upon collision. Players should make sure that the healthy ball doesnâ€™t get in contact with the deadly virus by either moving away from it or protect it by freezing a healthy ball to a safe ball. An infected ball can be cured using a cure ball, which moves in random directions and appears for every 10 seconds throughout the game. Your goal is to score enough to move to the next level.

### Genre

### Goal
Survive each level by keeping the number of infected balls below the threshold until the time runs out

## Inspiration
COVID-19 pandemic has swept through nations across the world in 2020, and has posed an unprecedented crisis. The virus is primarily transmitted through close contact amongst people. Various preventive measures and containment methodologies have been proposed. A multitude of governments, most notably, have encouraged wearing face masks, social distancing and in some cases conducted contact tracing.

Contact Tracers was designed in this time of intense difficulty. Players are expected to isolate one or more entities from the rest, and keep track of who is infected. As demonstrated in the game play, battling an infectious disease does involve a collaborative effort of all the members. Raising awareness, in this sense, can be one of the crucial components of limiting the number of cases.

## Mechanics
Draw a line between the virus and a healthy ball to move away from the virus
Draw a circle around a healthy ball to freeze it and protect from viruses.

### Cure mechanism
A Cure ball moves in random directions and appears for every 10 seconds during the game. Upon collision with an infected ball, it transforms the infected ball to a healthy one.

### Safe ball mechanism
Players can draw a circle around any healthy ball to freeze it and keep it safe from viruses. Note that only, only two balls can be frozen at a time.

### Score mechanism
At the end of each level,

- The player gets 10 points for every healthy ball and every safe ball.
- The player loses 10 points for every infected ball.

### End Condition
  - Win condition: Player scores the minimum number of points required to pass the level within the given time limit
  - Lose condition: Player fails to score the expected score within the given time limit
